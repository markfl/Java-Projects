# RefundsReturns
The purpose of this project was to gain experience with Swing & AS400 Toolbox for Java. Also added some experience reading a table 
on iSeries and put the data in a listbox. Added a rootine to parse a XML file. Went to a remote Unix box to retrieve sales & returns 
data. XML file held the configuration & login data so there wouldn't be any hard coding. Configuration file is not included in this
repository.
